# supreme-restock-monitor
### Userscript to send a discord webhook when an item on Supreme Newyork comes back in stock.

Note: this will trigger if the item is already in stock. Only enable this script when the item you want to monitor is **out of stock**

To use the Checkout Webhook, simply insert your webhook where it says to, and whenever the page to say that you have bought the item loads up, it will send a webhook with the details. Enjoy!
